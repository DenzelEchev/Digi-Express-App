# Digi-Express-App

## Objective of the project
Uses Digimon API to get an object to contain the names, upon post request it will compare the input from the form to the names in the object and then if it matches it will push to the dB otherwise it will send back an err. After that if you click on the name/card it will fetch from the api again and it will send back an image.
